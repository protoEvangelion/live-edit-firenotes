## Process

### Gathering Requirements

-   Probably the most important part of the process.
-   If you botch this, you'll be dealing with change orders and scope-creep throughout the entire project.
-   Poor planning is why agencies have project managers and why many freelancers hate their clients.
-   Ask lots of questions
-   Get lots of examples
-   Break down each page into functionality
-   Ask about **budget**
-   Clarify who will be updating the site
-   Do these things in person if possible

### Figuring out the quote

-   Break it down into major functional areas that don't necessarily depend on each other.
-   **Multi-staged** quotes are great because if it's too expensive, the client knows they can add additional features later in the project.
-   Explain the tech you will use in relation to how it will help their business, or how easy it will be for them to manage.

#### Presenting the quote

-   List what will be included
-   List what won't be included
-   Make your quote valid for **two weeks**
-   Create a template that looks professional
-   Our agency had a professional template, printed on heavy paper in an embossed folder with our logo on it.
    -   You don't have to go this far, but experience matters. Think Apple. You can quote more if you have a higher perception of quality.

### Timelines

-   Timelines should include **hard dates**.
-   You should have a "hard on" and and "hard off".
-   Assume 24-hour turnaround on questions
-   Be generous with your estimates. Under promise, over deliver.
-   Quoting time is a huge skill

### Contract

-   You best have one
-   Spell out what the client is getting (from quote)
-   At the very least, have the client sign your quote
-   Clear communication and a good relationship is extremely important
-   Use online templates, or have a lawyer create something specific

### Setting Expectations

-   Don't make yourself available 24/7
-   Establish a professional environment by not being too casual
-   Your choices will set the course for your relationship
-   Don't be too quick to reply to email
-   Schedule emails for 10 a.m.

### Design

-   **Collect all assets** from your client
    -   Logo
    -   Brand guidelines
    -   List of likes and dislikes
        -   try to understand type of company
        -   make person happy with overall vibe
-   Create initial look and feel
-   Don't show client **too early**—they can be distracted by little unfinished things
    -   a practical idea for this is to push up one feature at a time and request feedback on it
-   Back up the "whys" of what you did.
    -   Otherwise, it's just a pretty picture and and the client only thinks about it in terms of taste.
    -   Remember, you are the expert they hired, so it's not totally subjective—you have the expertise and you need to flex that.
        -   This button is teal because it's your call to action—this is the button that makes you money so we want to highlight that
        -   Grey text on white background is hard to read—you'll be leaving people out if you do this.
-   Be prepared for non-standard feedback
    -   E.g. this feels cloudy, can it look more sunny? Please make it pop, etc.
    -   Don't get offended by feedback on creative work
    -   Clients didn't go to art school and don't know about good feedback.
    -   Clients will ignore all finished aspects of a design and only focus on the one minor thing that's incorrect.

### Development

-   **Clear requirements** make development much easier.
    -   if you spec out all the parts of design it will be much easier to dev
-   Sometimes this starts at the same time or in the process of design.
-   Only show dev progress if client is capable of understanding dev process.
    -   Showing a developed site too early can cause clients to worry about visual aspects that aren't yet in line with the design.
    -   Showing to early is also a recipe for a feedback list of things you already know.
-   Give regular **progress updates**, as previously established.
    -   Make it happen on a schedule so expectations are set and so you won't forget.
    -   Stick to your timeline!
-   Clients don't care about technical jargon.
    -   Don't tell clients about Gatsby/React as much as telling them about the benefits, how fast the site is, etc.

### Feedback and revisions

-   Feedback is done in revisions or **rounds**.
-   For **smaller** projects, have your client email (one email) a list of feedback.
-   For **larger** projects, and more technical clients, use bug tracking software, such as Github issues, Trello, etc.
-   Write down everything, and then have a **follow-up call to discuss the feedback**.

### Deployment

-   Get your client to pay for domains and hosting.
-   Make sure their old website has everything off of it, or host the website somewhere else.
-   If you're moving servers, best to just point the A records at the new server.
-   If changing nameservers for DNS, make sure the client doesn't have:
    -   email
    -   files
        -   Many clients use their server to uploaded PDFs and other files that may still need to be accessible.
    -   other apps on that server that will be nuked or broken when moving
-   If you are changing URL structure, you'll need to be aware of any redirects.
-   **Backup** strategies
    -   GitHub could be enough
    -   It could be a plugin in WordPress or Drupal
    -   It could be on a chron job
-   **Restoration** strategies
    -   how do you get back up and running as fast as possible

### Handoff

-   turn off anything they don't need
    -   it's pretty easy to do this in WordPress
    -   lock down plugins if they don't need access
-   Create a video detailing how to do each thing
-   Don't give more options than they need in the back end.
-   Do in-person training when possible.
-   Only teach them the things that are important for their day to day usage.

### Bug fixes and support

-   Very common for clients with wrong idea of project guidelines to want to add on at the end of a project.
-   Not about adding new, non-established features.
-   Emergency bugs require an emergency response if they are your fault
    -   you should fix these immediately if you caused this.
-   **Set expectations** and be careful what you promise.

### What to do when things go to shit

-   There should be a trail of communication leading up to things going awry.
-   Try to mitigate things while they are small problems
    -   Don't wait until they snowball
-   Project is behind.
-   Product is not met with acceptance.
    -   This is something that should have been recognized in requirements
    -   you should have drawn this out of your client earlier
-   Client isn't paying.
-   When to fire your client.
    -   When they break the contract multiple times
    -   when they don't do what you agreed upon

## Branding

### Generalist or Specialist

-   You can choose to brand yourself as having a specialty
    -   Profit margins are higher here
-   Or you can brand yourself as the guy who builds websites
-   You also have to ask yourself if you want to run the business aspect of things or someone else too

### Billing & Pricing

-   value based piecemeal billing is more preferred than hourly billing
    -   fixed base billing
    -   this is a skill that you learn as you go along
-   If the scope of the work is really fuzzy, then hourly based billing works fine
-   Be comfortable talking about money
    -   talk about what you think a feature will cost
    -   it's ok to go back and forth
