## Notes from The Pragmatic Programmer

-   _Pragmaticus_: latin for "skilled in business"
-   Team based software construction should be rigorous and disciplined
    -   This however does not preclude individual creativity and craftsmanship
-   _Kaizen_: Japanese term for continuously making small improvements
    -   the reason for dramatic gains in productivity and quality in Japanese manufacturing

### The Philosophy

> Pragmatic programming is a philosophy of approaching problems and their solutions while looking at the bigger picture

#### Excuses

-   Don't make excuses, make solutions
-   Don't blame your computer, software, or other things (you should have made contingencies)
-   If you are the leader or could have prevented it, take responsibility and think of solutions to fix the problem now and/or ways to prevent it in the future.

#### Entropy

-   Entropy relates to the amount of disorder in a system
    -   Nature tends toward disorder
        -   **Software rot** is when disorder increases

> One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment--sense that the powers that be don't care about the building.

-   If your code has a broken window, board it up
    -   comment out offending code
    -   add an implementation message
    -   take some action to prevent further damage
-   **Neglect** accelerates rot faster than any other factor
    -   When you are on a team where everything is clean & elegant, you take more care not to mess it up

#### Good Enough Software

-   A lot of the time users are willing to _live with software that is a bit buggy_ but allows them to do what they want to do
-   You have to to weigh the risk reward ratio in your sphere of whether or not it's worth the investment to perfect the software
-   Also, you need to know when to stop
    -   Artists say that hard work is ruin if they over paint
    -   The painting gets lost in the paint

#### Invest in your Knowledge Portfolio

> It's a lot like managing an investment portfolio

1. **Invest Regularly**: even if small amount (think compound interest)
2. **Diversify**: The more tech you are comfortable with, the better you can adapt to change
3. **Manage Risk**: Choose wisely which shiny new tech you invest in
4. **Buy Low, Sell High**: It's worth it to invest in new languages. Those who got on the Java train when it first came out were rewarded handsomely
5. **Review & Rebalance**: Is it time to brush up on DB tech? Or how bout positioning yourself for a job opening

_Challenges_:

-   learn a new language a year
-   read a technical book each quarter
-   read a non technical book each quarter
-   take classes
-   participate in one meetup
-   Go to a trade show or conf
