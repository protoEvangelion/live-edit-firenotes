## Intro

The structure of this intro is organized around the "Three Ways" which outline values & philosophies that guide DevOps processes & practices:

I. The First Way - accelerate the delivery of IT services with **Continuous Delivery** and using principles and practices that lead to an accelerated flow.

II. The Second Way - amplify feedback loops by creating a problem-solving culture, understand monitoring, monitoring business metrics, and changing how management applies DevOps.

III. The Third Way - patterns of organizational learning and safety culture that include blameless postmortems, resilience engineering, and systems thinking.

-   [_Why the name “DevOps”?_](http://dev2ops.org/2010/02/what-is-devops/)

    -   Probably because it’s catchy
    -   It’s also a good mental image of the concept at the widest scale — when you bring Dev and Ops together you get DevOps

-   Devops enables:
    -   ["It Alignment"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business/IT_alignment)
        -   a desired state in which a business organization is able to use information technology (IT) effectively to achieve business objectives — typically improved financial performance or marketplace competitiveness
    -   ["Agility"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_agility)
        -   ability of an organization to rapidly adapt to market and environmental changes in productive and cost-effective ways

## History

-   [A brief history of IT Operations, DevOps, and NoOps](https://blog.appdynamics.com/engineering/is-noops-the-end-of-devops-think-again/)
    -   In traditional IT organizations, developers and system administrators have opposing goals.
        -   **Developers’** primary focus is to _build features_
        -   **operations’** focus is to ensure the _availability, reliability, performance, and security_ of the features in production
    -   The **Wall of Confusion**, illustrates the barrier between development and operations
        -   which leads to an unending series of outages, fire fighting, blame shifting, internal tension, customer frustration, and business failure.
    -   In the late **1980s**, **IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)** emerged
        -   a set of standards and _best practices shared by the highest performing IT organizations_
        -   promised high change success rates and prevented typical disasters associated with software deployment, but **at the expense of speed** and slowing down workflow
    -   Meanwhile, the software development community was busy forming their own best practices for the rapid development of applications.
        -   In **2001**, a summit of prominent software craftsmen drafted the **Agile Manifesto**, kickstarting the agile development movement into full gear
        -   The agile principles empowered small, cross-functional teams to _build high-quality software faster_ than ever before.
    -   The rise of the internet **during the 1990s** was the catalyst that fueled the demand for better, faster, more sophisticated software
        -   Technologies advancements arose:
            -   version control
            -   continuous integration
            -   configuration management
            -   virtualization
    -   In **2006**, the need for better processes and tools reached a critical mass with the public launch of _Amazon Web Services_.
        -   With the advent of cloud computing, _software teams could now outsource their physical infrastructure entirely to cloud providers_
        -   And instead manage virtual infrastructure resources via APIs
        -   This **infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model** allowed development teams to move faster
            -   No longer having to wait on IT to order and provision new hardware
    -   **One year later**, **platform as a service (PaaS) solutions,** such as _Heroku_ and _CloudFoundry_, made it possible for a single developer _with no operations experience_ to launch a scalable web application over the weekend, because the platform automated everything from commit to deploy.
    -   The **pivotal moment in DevOps history** was the [groundbreaking presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4)
        -   from _John Allspaw and Paul Hammond_ at the 2009 Velocity Conference—10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr.
        -   About how a large company with complex software could successfully deploy a product multiple times per day
        -   Shocked IT community
    -   **Devopsdays** conf then launced
        -   Is a worldwide tour of locally organized conferences for developers, sysadmins, and other software professionals to meet and share their stories, ideas, and challenges. Some common themes discussed at Devopsdays include fostering a culture of community and collaboration, blameless post mortems, and applying agile practices and lean manufacturing principles to IT operations.
    -   Other movements then arose: \* _Docker_
        _ An open-source container management platform that brought DIY PaaS solutions to the masses
        _ _Kubernetes_
        _ A popular container orchestration framework
        _ _AWS Lambda_ \* The first widespread example of Serverless computing in which functions run on demand without the need for a server to run continuously
