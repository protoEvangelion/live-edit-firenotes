## Process

#### 1. Resume

-   Get a recommendation
-   Make sure experience is relevant

#### 2. Coding Challenge

-   Clean, correct code
-   Don't miss details

#### 3. Recruiter Phone Screen

-   Read the company's engineering blog
-   Learn about the company
-   Ask engaging questions
-   Have highlights ready
-   Have notes up

#### 4. Technical Phone Screen

-   Sometimes it will be a simple algo to check if you can code
-   Shorter than onsite interview (around 45 min)
-   Be able to discuss previous projects in depth
-   Have a good balance of conversational and formal tone

#### 5. Onsite Interview

-   Little longer
-   Communicate clearer
-   Have CS fundamentals
-   Learn the fundamentals of algos, don't have to get into the weeds
-   Talk through your thought process especially when you hit a speed bump
-   Questions can range from Comp Sci, to Language specific, to Frameworks, to math

## Pro Tips

### algos

1.  Don't aim to memorize just understand the higher level
2.  Find themes and don't jump to conclusions
3.  Practice with a timer, speed matters
4.  Actually practice, reading doesn't count
5.  If you ever do in-place algos, you have mutable side effects
    -   save space but can have unintended side effects
    -   discuss with interviewer

### resources

-   InterviewBit
-   LeetCode or Hacker Rank (excersizes)
-   Interviewing.io or Pramp (real interviews)
-   Geeks for Geeks

-   Cracking the coding interview (js solutions online)

## Common Interview Q's

### Stack & Queue

-   Use an array to implement 3 stacks
-   Implement a getMin() or getMax() method on your stack
-   Create a queue using 2 stacks
    -   So you have to make 2 stacks behave like a queue
-   Sort a stack with the min values in order, on top. You can use another stack as a buffer
-   Write a function that returns true if a string of brackets is valid/balanced
    -   string bracket validator

### Linked List

-   Delete the following:
    -   a node in the middle of the linked List
    -   a node with only a variable pointing at that node
    -   a duplicate (is it already sorted?)
        -   if not you would have to sort (n log n)
-   Partition a linked list around a value
-   Write a function for reversing a linked list
    -   Can you do it in place?
-   Check if a linked list contains a cycle
-   Find the kth to the last node

### Hash Table

-   Count the number of occurrences of all characters or words in a body of text or string
-   Delete duplicates in a list
-   Find a unique value in a list
-   Find if two integers in a list add up to k

### Array / string

-   Rotate a matrix, string, or an array
-   Given an m x n boolean matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0
-   Search foa value
-   Write a function encodes a string by turning all spaces in `%20`
-   Merge two sorted lists into one list
