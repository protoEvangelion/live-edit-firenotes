## Master Tips

> Always, always, always favor **readability**. If it is a bottleneck to perf come back and fix it later

**Stability** is something you want to keep in mind when picking an algo

-   If there is a bug in your code, think of where you are lacking in understanding because the root of bugs is where your brain diverges from how the computer actually works ~ Kyle Simpson

-   The more imperitavely you write code, the more you actually make it harder for the engine to optimize your code ~ Kyle Simpson

-   Code that you cannot understand is code that you cannot trust...the reverse is also true ~ Kyle Simpson

-   There is one thing that computers will never be better than us at--communicating empathetically with humans ~ Kyle Simpson

-   Our goal when writing code, is to write it so clearly that a developer can understand what your program does on their first pass ~ Kyle Simpson

-   As is relates to FP es6 was a push to give us more declarative tools to write our code so we can think about the bigger picture! ~ Kyle Simpson

-   The best code is the code that is most readable in the future because it strikes exactly the right balance between what it can/should be (idealism) and what it must be (pragmatism) [1]

-   Reminder, any extensibility point that’s never used isn’t just wasted effort, it’s likely to also get in your way as well [2]

### Algos are all about **tradeoffs**

> **Pro Tip** If you cannot see the variable on the same page, "redeclare it" so the reader knows exactly what scope it belongs to

## Top 5 Capacities You Should Develop

1.  Analytical problem solving with code
2.  Technical communication (can I implement your approach just from your explanation)
3.  Engineering best practices and approach (Debugging, code structure, patience and reference to docs)
4.  Non-technical communication (empathetic and thoughtful communication)
5.  Language and comp sci experience

## Pair Programming

-   A secret to growing into a junior or senior level engineer
-   Hard learning is where you grow the most
-   **Hard Learning Spectrum**
    1.  _The Researcher Trap_
    -   Doing the hard work but you just get stuck researching and never get to coding
    2.  _The StackOverflow Approach_
    -   Take snippet try it, it doesn't work, try another snippet......
-   Pair programming solves the hard learning dilema
