# I ❤️ functional programming

In JavaScript, I have dealt with the acute pain of object oriented codebases and experienced the bliss of working in reliable functional systems. It's 2020, and for whatever reason, the vast majority of web devs think functional programming is merely "programming with functions". My goal is to spread awareness of the benefits of aligning with functional paradigms like: immutability, quarantining side effects, pure functions, composition, & transformations to name a few. This blog is one of the ways I am trying to bring this dream to reality!
